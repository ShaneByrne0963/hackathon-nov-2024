## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py` if your Python file is named `app.py`, of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

By Default, Gitpod gives you superuser security privileges. Therefore, you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public, you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

### Connecting your Mongo database

- **Connect to Mongo CLI on a IDE**
- navigate to your MongoDB Clusters Sandbox

## UX

### Colour Scheme

We've used CSS for the colours to simplify switching theme colours quickly (if necessary).

```css
:root {
    --black: 0, 0, 0; /* #000000 */
    --white: 255, 255, 255; /* #FFFFFF */
    --offwhite: 250, 250, 250; /* #FAFAFA */

    --united-red: 255, 0, 0; /* #FF0000 */
    --united-orange: 255, 127, 0; /* #FF7F00 */
    --united-yellow: 255, 255, 0; /* #FFFF00 */
    --united-green: 0, 255, 0; /* #00FF00 */
    --united-blue: 0, 0, 255; /* #0000FF */
    --united-indigo: 75, 0, 130; /* #4B0082 */
    --united-violet: 139, 0, 255; /* #8B00FF */

    --united-grey-light: 125, 125, 125; /* #7D7D7D */
    --united-grey-dark: 58, 58, 58; /* #3A3A3A */

    --united-primary: 241, 26, 123; /* #F11A7B */
    --united-secondary: 152, 33, 118; /* #982176 */
    --united-tertiary: 0, 101, 119;  /* #006577 */
    --united-quaternary: 255, 201, 83; /* #FFC953 */
}
```

We've used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/f11a7b-982176-006577-ffc953-000000-fafafa) to generate our colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolers.png)


### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

### Home Page
- As a user, it should be clear what the website is about and its purpose so I know how to navigate it.
- As a user, the home page should provide a link to the page with the calendar with the events in.


#### User


By breaking down these user stories into more granular steps, you can ensure that all aspects of the user registration and authentication process are covered and can be implemented systematically.

### Contact Us Page


### General 

- As a user, I expect all the links to be working as expected across the website so I don't come across any broken links.
- As a user, I expect the styling to be consistent across the pages so that I everything looks appealing visually.
- As a user, I expect the website to be responsive on all different screen sizes so I can view all content and information easily.
- As an admin, I should be able to update an Event, so that I can maintain a clean database, clean any mistakes, or remove events no longer needed.
- As an admin, I should be able to delete an Event, so that I can maintain a clean database, clean any mistakes, or remove events no longer needed.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
We've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design our site wireframes.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/ShaneByrne0963/hackathon-nov-2024/projects/3) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and tasks were planned, then tracked on a daily basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/other-images/kanban-board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ShaneByrne0963/hackathon-nov-2024/issues) served as an another Agile tool.

It also helped with iterations on a daily basis.


- [Open Issues](https://github.com/ShaneByrne0963/hackathon-nov-2024/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/ShaneByrne0963/hackathon-nov-2024)](https://github.com/ShaneByrne0963/hackathon-nov-2024/issues)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

We've decomposed our Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, we were able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to our user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration


### Database

~~### Deployment

~~This project uses , a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.~~

Deployment steps are as follows, ~~after account setup:~~


~~The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!~~

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking our repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `‚åò+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShaneByrne0963/hackathon-nov-2024) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone our repository:

- **Game Settings Page**
    - Upon entering the website, the user is greeted with an assortment of options that lets them customize their game experience.
    - The first setting is a select input requesting the type of players that will play the game. There are 3 different options:
        - Player versus Player
        - Player versus Computer
        - Computer versus Computer
    - ![The players select input](assets/images/readme/user-interface/select-players.PNG)
    - This select input will change the rest of the inputs depending on what is selected. This is done so that settings that are only relevant to the type of players are shown to the user.
    - ![The inputs that depend on the player type](assets/images/readme/user-interface/settings-dynamic.PNG)
    - Below the dynamic settings There is a drop-down menu for advanced moves. These are hidden by default to prevent too much information being displayed on the screen on page load.
    - ![The advanced moves](assets/images/readme/user-interface/advanced-moves.PNG)
    - Centered at the bottom of the settings element, there is an anchor element that takes the user to the game, applying all the settings that have been inputted
    - If the user selected "Computer vs. Computer", the text for the anchor will change from "Play Game!" to "Watch Game!" as the user will not be interacting with the game on this setting
    - ![The anchor go to the game page](assets/images/readme/user-interface/game-anchor.PNG)
    - The game settings page gives the user a lot of control over how their game is played

- **Game Page**
    
    - The game page is made up of several UI elements:
        - The chess board
        - The player turn heading
        - 2 player user interfaces
        - An announcements section
        - A game options section
        - A banner over the chess board
    - ![The user interface elements put together on a desktop screen](assets/images/readme/user-interface/game.PNG)
    - *Chess Board:*
        - This is where the main gameplay happens
        - The board is made up of an 8x8 grid of tiles
        - The user can interact with their pieces to select them when it is their turn, and can click on any tile the selected piece can move to
        - The possible moves are represented by icons that appear over the tile. There are different icons for different moves
    - ![The chess board showing the possible moves of the rook](assets/images/readme/user-interface/chess-board.PNG)
    - *Player Turn Heading*
        - Notifies the user which player is currently taking their turn
        - Always situated on the top-left corner of the screen, making it more likely for the user to notice it
    - ![The player turn heading notifying the player it is their turn](assets/images/readme/user-interface/turn-heading.PNG)
    - *Player User Interfaces*
        - Underneath the player turn heading are 2 player user interfaces side by side. For mobile screens they appear under the announcement
        - At the top of this UI, the player's name and their color represented by the king piece to the right of it is displayed
        - In the middle, there is an array of icons for each piece that player has eliminated
        - If a player's pawn reaches the other side of the board and has to pick an eliminated piece to promote to, the icons that the player can revive will begin to flash. This is done to draw attention to the user so they know what to click on
        - At the bottom of the UI, there is a clock icon with the amount of time the user has to make the move remaining. This feature is only available in player vs player, and if the user requested a time limit
        - If the UI belongs to the player that is taking their turn, the element will have a white outline, making it clearer whose turn it is
    - ![The 2 player user interfaces side by side](assets/images/readme/user-interface/player-ui.PNG)
    - *Announcements*
        - Announcements appear under the player user interfaces for desktop and under the chess board for tablets and mobile phones
        - Each time an event happens, a new notification will appear at the bottom of the element, notifying the user of the event
        - The announcements will let the user know about a pawn elimination, check, checkmate or timeout
        - Any new announcements will be gold in color until the next turn, differentiating it from announcements that are less relevant
        - This part of the user interface is important because it informs the user about what is happening in the game, in case there is something they missed or did not notice
    - ![The announcements part of the user interface](assets/images/readme/user-interface/announcements.PNG)
    - *Game Options*
        - Situated at the bottom of the user interface, this section consists of 2 buttons
        - The first button resets the game, clearing any changes and setting up the chess board. This button does not take the user to another page
        - The second button is an anchor that returns the user to the game settings page
        - This main purpose of this part of the UI is to allow the user to make changes to the game settings if they are not happy with them, or start the game over if desired
    - ![The 2 game options buttons](assets/images/readme/user-interface/game-options.PNG)
    - *Banner*
        - The banner displays a heading, subheading and sometimes a grid of icons over the chess board and is only visible when the game has paused or ended
        - This only happens when a player is promoting a pawn, on checkmate or if a player runs out of time
        - On pawn promotion, if the user has chosen to promote the pawn to any piece, 4 icons, the knight, the bishop, the rook and the queen, will appear under the text
        - The color of these icons depends on the color of the player that has activated the banner
        - On game end, the banner will disappear after 5 seconds to allow the user to see the board again, if they desire
        - Because the banner appears over the chess board, it is a very effective way of informing the player of the steps they need to take to continue the game, without leaving the user wondering what to do next
